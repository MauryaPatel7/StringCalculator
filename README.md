# StringCalculatorTDD
StringCalculatorTDD is a way to understand TDD through a project for beginners.
Here, we in a stepwise manner develop a calculator which adds numbers from strings separated by delimiters.
# What I learned
Reading and interpreting a code is more difficult than writing the code. If the code is well structured and clean with appropriate comments then it makes the job much easier. TDD helps us in developing the codes in such a way that another developer/programmer can read and understand it while the code being bug free.
